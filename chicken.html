      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that
      arose from the red junglefowl, originally from Southeast Asia. They have
      also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
      junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock
      are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castr ated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans
      keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consumin g both their meat
      and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting,
      which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat
      are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19
      billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
      There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and
      religion, as well as in language and literature.
